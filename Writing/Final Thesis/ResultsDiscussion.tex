\section{Results}
- show annex with screenshots of tests
- Successful for all arbitrary rotation gates using native Pulser U gate
- successful for 2 qubit gates CZ and CX
- unseccessful translation from Pulser\_U to QASM\_U: $|1 \rangle$ state is in the wrong phase. (could be solved if the Phase gate could be implemented, since this gate produces a phase shift around the $|1 \rangle$ state).
- Rydberg Blockade testing (hopefully successful, will know for certain on 24th may)\\
- Parsing mostly unsuccessful due to length of the task (show some screenshots of what it can do so far)
