\begin{abstract}
  OpenQASM is a low-level programming language for quantum computing, which can be adapted to any quantum computer. This paper is a preliminary study on the feasibility of writing an OpenQASM compiler for a neutral atom quantum computer. The code base required to parse QASM code was defined. Following this, the ability to translate both single-qubit and multi-qubit quantum logic gates to physical optical pulses within the computer was investigated using Pascal's simulator library: Pulser. Finally, the constraints imposed by multi-qubit gates on the creation of a qubit regirster in Pulser were also identified. 
Overall this study determines that creating a compiler for OpenQASM is feasible, as long as a way to implement the Phase gate is found.
