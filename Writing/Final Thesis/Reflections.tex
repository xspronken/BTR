\section{Critical Reflection}
\label{criticalreflection}

- Project taking much longer than planned and more complex than expected\\
- Parsing very long, redundant and repetitive work. (need to account for all user errors and syntax etc.)
- First time working with very limited documentation and having to discover things through experimenting and analyzing source code of simulation libraries \\ 
- initial method of wanting a fully functional pipeline from the get go (even for a simple algorithm ) was naive.
