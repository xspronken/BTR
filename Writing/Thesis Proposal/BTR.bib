  abstract = {Rydberg atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum computing and simulation, combining strong interactions with highly coherent operations and flexible geometries. However, the achievable fidelities are limited by the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states, as well as technical imperfections such as atomic motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Rydberg atom arrays using long-lived circular Rydberg states in optical traps. Based on the extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around \$10\^\{-5\}\$ can be realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements, including a quantum nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and robust dynamical decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the current state-of-the-art in quantum computing and simulation with neutral atoms.},

After an overview of architectural options and approaches to preparing large qubit arrays we examine Rydberg mediated gate protocols and fidelity for two- and multi-qubit interactions. Quantum simulation and Rydberg dressing are alternatives to circuit based quantum computing for exploring many body quantum dynamics. We review the properties of the dressing interaction and provide a quantitative figure of merit for the complexity of the coherent dynamics that can be accessed with dressing. We conclude with a summary of the current status and an outlook for future progress.},

It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics. The advances of the last decade are reviewed, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of Rydberg-mediated quantum information processing.},

  abstract = {We show how a pulse-level implementation of the multi-qubit gates in neutral-atom device architectures allows for the simultaneous execution of single- and multi-qubit gates acting on overlapping sets of qubits, in a mechanism we name absorption. With absorption as a foundation, we present an algorithm to schedule the execution of a quantum circuit as a pulse sequence on a neutral-atom device with a single channel for single- and multi-qubit gate execution. For any quantum circuit of practical relevance, we observe that the algorithm results in an optimal utilization of the available resources that cannot be surpassed by a different scheduling strategy. Our benchmarks against a custom scheduler attempting to maximize parallelization at the gate level show the time gained by the pulse-level scheduler is proportional to the depth and is most pronounced for quantum circuits with fewer qubits.},
