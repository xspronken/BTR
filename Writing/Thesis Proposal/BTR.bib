  abstract = {A great challenge in current quantum science and technology research is to realize artificial systems of a large number of individually controlled quantum bits for applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation. Many experimental platforms are being explored, including solid-state systems, such as superconducting circuits1 or quantum dots2, and atomic, molecular and optical systems, such as photons, trapped ions or neutral atoms3\textendash 7. The latter offer inherently identical qubits that are well decoupled from the environment and could provide synthetic structures scalable to hundreds of qubits or more8. Quantum-gas microscopes9 allow the realization of two-dimensional regular lattices of hundreds of atoms, and large, fully loaded arrays of about 50 microtraps (or `optical tweezers') with individual control are already available in one10 and two11 dimensions. Ultimately, however, accessing the third dimension while keeping single-atom control will be required, both for scaling to large numbers and for extending the range of models amenable to quantum simulation. Here we report the assembly of defect-free, arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional arrays, containing up to 72 single atoms. We use holographic methods and fast, programmable moving tweezers to arrange\textemdash atom by atom and plane by plane\textemdash initially disordered arrays into target structures of almost any geometry. These results present the prospect of quantum simulation with tens of qubits arbitrarily arranged in space and show that realizing systems of hundreds of individually controlled qubits is within reach using current technology.},

  abstract = {Rydberg atom arrays are a leading platform for quantum computing and simulation, combining strong interactions with highly coherent operations and flexible geometries. However, the achievable fidelities are limited by the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states, as well as technical imperfections such as atomic motion. In this work, we propose a novel approach to Rydberg atom arrays using long-lived circular Rydberg states in optical traps. Based on the extremely long lifetime of these states, exceeding seconds in cryogenic microwave cavities that suppress radiative transitions, and gate protocols that are robust to finite atomic temperature, we project that arrays of hundreds of circular Rydberg atoms with two-qubit gate errors around \$10\^\{-5\}\$ can be realized using current technology. This approach combines several key elements, including a quantum nondemolition detection technique for circular Rydberg states, local manipulation using the ponderomotive potential of focused optical beams, a gate protocol using multiple circular levels to encode qubits, and robust dynamical decoupling sequences to suppress unwanted interactions and errors from atomic motion. This represents a significant improvement on the current state-of-the-art in quantum computing and simulation with neutral atoms.},

  abstract = {Quantum assembly languages are machine-independent languages that traditionally describe quantum computation in the circuit model. Open quantum assembly language (OpenQASM 2) was proposed as an imperative programming language for quantum circuits based on earlier QASM dialects. In principle, any quantum computation could be described using OpenQASM 2, but there is a need to describe a broader set of circuits beyond the language of qubits and gates. By examining interactive use cases, we recognize two different timescales of quantum-classical interactions: real-time classical computations that must be performed within the coherence times of the qubits, and near-time computations with less stringent timing. Since the near-time domain is adequately described by existing programming frameworks, we choose in OpenQASM 3 to focus on the real-time domain, which must be more tightly coupled to the execution of quantum operations. We add support for arbitrary control flow as well as calling external classical functions. In addition, we recognize the need to describe circuits at multiple levels of specificity, and therefore we extend the language to include timing, pulse control, and gate modifiers. These new language features create a multi-level intermediate representation for circuit development and optimization, as well as control sequence implementation for calibration, characterization, and error mitigation.},

  abstract = {For superconducting qubits, microwave pulses drive rotations around the Bloch sphere. The phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration arbitrary virtual Z gates, which, combined with two X{$\pi$}/2 gates, can generate any SU(2) gate. Here we show how to best utilize these virtual Z gates to both improve algorithms and correct pulse errors. We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration X and Y gates. Z gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse-shaping techniques such as derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG). We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and Z gates to correct rotation errors realizes a 13.3 ns X{$\pi$}/2 gate characterized by low error [1.95(3)\texttimes 10-4] and low leakage [3.1(6)\texttimes 10-6]. Ultimately leakage is limited by the finite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders of magnitude smaller than pulse errors due to decoherence.},

It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics. The advances of the last decade are reviewed, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of Rydberg-mediated quantum information processing.},

With absorption as a foundation, we present an algorithm to schedule the execution of a quantum circuit as a pulse sequence on a neutral-atom device with a single channel for single- and multi-qubit gate execution. For any quantum circuit of practical relevance, we observe that the algorithm results in an optimal utilization of the available resources that cannot be surpassed by a different scheduling strategy. Our benchmarks against a custom scheduler attempting to maximize parallelization at the gate level show the time gained by the pulse-level scheduler is proportional to the depth and is most pronounced for quantum circuits with fewer qubits.},
