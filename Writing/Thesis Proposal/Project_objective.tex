\section{Project Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

The Thesis objective is to compile a logical OpenQASM circuit into a physical circuit on Pasqal's neutral atom quantum computer. 
This is achievable in four steps. First, QASM code isi parsed to retrieve the number of qubits 
used and which gates are applied to them. Once the code has been parsed, the qubits are mapped into a register that satisfies the constraints imposed by the multi-qubit gates. Following the creation of the register 
the gates are translated into adequate optical pulses. 
Finally, the compiled quantum circuit is tested through simulation, or on a real quantum device if available.
