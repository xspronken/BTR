\section{Project Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

The objective of this thesis is to create a QASM compiler for Pasqal's neutral atom quantum computer. 
This is achievable in four steps, the first is to parse the QASM code to retrieve the number of qubits 
used and which gates are applied to them. Once the code has been parsed, a register of qubits has to be 
created that satisfies the constraints imposed by the multi-qubit gates. Following the creation of the register 
the gates can be translated into adequate optical pulses. 
Finally, the compiled quantum circuit can be tested through simulation, or on a real quantum device if available.
