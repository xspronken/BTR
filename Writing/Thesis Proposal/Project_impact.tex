Considering all the different approaches to implementing quantum computing, OpenQASM's position as a hardware-agnostic language may set it up to be
 a universal layer that all higher-level quantum software languages could translate to and hence work on any quantum computer. This would allow quantum algorithms, such as 
 Grover's algorithm, to work on any quantum computer, as long as it is written in OpenQASM. However, for this to be the case OpenQASM compilers need to exist for all 
 the different types of quantum computers. This isn't the case yet for neutral atom quantum computers, or at least there is no open-source version available to the public.
 Thus this project aims to be the first open-source OpenQASM compiler for neutral atom quantum computers, more specifically Pasqal's device.
