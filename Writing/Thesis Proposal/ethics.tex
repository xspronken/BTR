\section{Ethical considedrations}
\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:Methodethics}
The software tools used to produce this project are all free and published under open-source licenses, and the different resources used will be cited adequately.
The code for the compiler will be stored in a GitHub repository and made public under an open-source license once it has acquired enough substance to be usable 
or useful to other researchers. Thus no further ethical considerations are thought to be required regarding the methodological approaches of this project.

\subsection{Impact}
\label{sec:Impactethics}
The main ethical concern for this project is that, while the project would produce an open-source solution to compiling OpenQASM, the main beneficiary of this code would
be Pasqal, a for-profit start-up. However, they seem to be committed to open-sourcing most of their code as is the case with Pulser. Thus a compiler such as this one would
help develop Pasqal's quantum technology further, while also keeping a majority of the knowledge open to the public and competition.
